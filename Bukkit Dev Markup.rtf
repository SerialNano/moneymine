\f0\fs24 \cf0 == Moneymine ==\
**If this is a plugin you are interested in, want to try, and want it to continue to be developed, please leave a comment.**\
\
=== What is it? ===\
Moneymine is an all-in-one jobs system. Unlike other plugins, which simply pay a player a fixed wage wether the do the work or not, Moneymine monitors certain aspects of the player, depending on the requirements of the job. For example, if the job created requires the player to mine, let's say, 1 stack of iron ore per day, then the player would only be paid if they mined 1 stack of iron between certain Minecraft hours (default is 12am to 11:59am). Also, there is a job applications system, complete with automatic resume generation. The player can be given a uniform to use during work hours. Lastly, we plan on, after the basic plugin is complete, using JSONAPI to integrate with an Android app designed specifically for Moneymine managers.\
\
**What makes Moneymine unique? Anyone with permission can create a fully customizable job for players to apply to\'96everything from the requirements to the uniform to the wage, and every other aspect of the job imaginable is customizable!**\
\
=== Commands & Permissions ===\
===== /createjob =====\
* Description: Command for creating a new job.\
* Usage: /createjob [jobname] [wage]\
* Permission: moneymine.job.create\
\
\
===== /setuniform =====\
* Description: Command for setting the uniform for a job.\
* Usage: /setuniform [job] [helmet  material] [chestplate material] [leggings material] [boots material]\
* Permission: moneymine.uniform.set\
\
=== How to Use ===\
Simply drag and drop the JAR file into your plugins folder.\
\
=== To Implement ===\
* Job application\
* Wage system\
* Work limits\
* Uniforms\
* Work timetable\
* Job requirements\
* Resum\'e8s\
* Vault integration\
* --MCStats integration-- **Done!**\
* Commission-based jobs\
* **So much more**\
\
===Coming in the Future===\
* Ability to set the color of custom uniform when using leather\
* Config option to connect to your own MySQL database\
\
===Known Caveats===\
* Armour given as a uniform provides protection, and players could potentially take advantage of this by creating a job and hiring themselves. SUGGESTED FIX: I will add in a block of code to nullify the armor's protection if it is given as a uniform.\
\
===Note to Admins===\
If, for any reason at all, you want to do a TOTAL reset on the plugin (wipe the database, the Moneymine private-stored data, all that fun stuff), it is easily possible to have the plugin reset itself to default. To do this, locate the directory in the Moneymine plugin folder called 'trd' (total reset of data). In the trd folder, there should be a file called 'rad.mny' (reset all data) and a file called 'yis.mny' (yes I'm sure). To make the plugin reset itself to factory defaults, simply delete these two files and reload the server. Viola!\
